# Overview
Image processing is an essential part of computer vision, enabling machines to interpret visual data. In this project, we use CNNs to classify images from a dataset, employing techniques such as normalization, data augmentation, and feature extraction.

This project covers:

Image preprocessing (normalization, resizing, etc.)
Data augmentation to enhance model robustness
# CNN-based image classification
Visualization of learned features (filters from convolutional layers)
Evaluation of model performance on test data
# Key Features
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): State-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, zoom, and shear to artificially expand the dataset and improve model generalization.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
# Dataset
This project uses the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, but you can adapt it for any other dataset as well. The SVHN dataset contains digit images captured from house numbers in natural scenes.

Training Set: Labeled images used to train the model.
Validation Set: Images used to validate the model during training.
Test Set: Separate images used to evaluate the final model's performance.
Image Dimensions: 32x32 pixels in RGB.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by max pooling, dropout for regularization, and dense layers for classification. The model is trained using categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

# Key layers:

Conv2D: Extracts features from images by applying filters.
MaxPooling2D: Reduces spatial dimensions.
BatchNormalization: Improves training stability and speed.
Dropout: Reduces overfitting by randomly dropping neurons.
Dense: Fully connected layers for classification.
Preprocessing and Data Augmentation
# The raw images are preprocessed by:

Normalization: Scaling pixel values between 0 and 1.
Label Binarization: Converting labels into one-hot encoded vectors for classification.
Data augmentation is applied using the ImageDataGenerator class to introduce variability into the dataset:

Random rotations
Zooming
Shifting
Shearing
These augmentations help improve model generalization to unseen data.

Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training data with an optional validation split. Early stopping and learning rate scheduling are used to optimize training.

Evaluation is done using:

Accuracy: Percentage of correctly classified images.
Loss: Categorical cross-entropy to measure the prediction error.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes true vs. predicted labels.
# Results
The model achieves competitive performance in recognizing digits within real-world scenes. Visualization of the training process is provided with plots of accuracy and loss over epochs.

Sample visualizations include:

Learning curves: Displaying training and validation accuracy/loss.
Confusion matrix: To analyze classification performance.
Convolutional filter activations: Visualizing the learned filters in the CNN.
